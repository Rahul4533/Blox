A. What did the system do?

The doctor appointment system facilitated the scheduling of appointments for patients with healthcare providers. 
It allowed patients to view available appointment slots, book appointments, cancel or reschedule them, and receive reminders.

B. What other systems have you seen in the wild like that?

Systems like Zocdoc, Practo, and Doctolib offer similar functionalities. 
They enable users to search for healthcare providers based on various criteria, book appointments online, and manage their appointments efficiently.

C. How do you approach the development problem?

In approaching the development problem, we focused on designing a user-friendly interface for both patients and healthcare providers. 
We prioritized features such as real-time availability updates, secure patient information handling, and integration with existing healthcare systems for seamless appointment management.

D. What were interesting aspects where you copied code from Stack Overflow?

One interesting aspect was implementing calendar integration for appointment scheduling.
We referred to Stack Overflow for code snippets related to handling date and time operations, integrating with popular calendar APIs like Google Calendar, and ensuring compatibility across different platforms and devices.

E. What did you learn from some very specific copy-paste? Mention explicitly some of them.

From specific instances of copying code from Stack Overflow, I learned the importance of error handling and validation. 
For example, when integrating with external APIs, it's crucial to handle edge cases such as network errors, API rate limits, and invalid input gracefully to provide a seamless user experience. 
Additionally, I learned about the significance of properly documenting and testing the integrated code to ensure reliability and maintainability over time
